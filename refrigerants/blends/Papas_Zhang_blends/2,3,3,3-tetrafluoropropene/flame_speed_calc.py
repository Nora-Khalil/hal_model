Papas, Zhang, p. 1150: "The stoichiometry for the hydrofluorocarbon-air systems considered was determined by taking the combustion products to be CO2, HF, and H2O. If there was insufficient hydrogen available for formation of HF and H2O, then the formation of HF took preference over H2O formation. If there was insufficient hydrogen available for all the fluorine to form HF, then the remaining fluorine was assumed to produce CF2O in preference of carbon forming CO2. "

Stoichiometric equation for 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoropropene is provided by https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022113917301586?via%3Dihub  (Babushok, Linteris): 

Assumed stoichiometric combustion for 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoropropene is: 

CH2CFCF3 + 2.5 (O2 + 3.76 N2) = 2 CO2 + CF20 + 2 HF + 2.5*3.76 N2


calculated phi as: 

at stoichiometric: CH2CFCF3: 0.4, O2: 1, N2: 3.76

therefore phi = (F/M ac) / (F/M stoich) = (x/(x+1+3.76))/(0.4/(0.4+1+3.76)) = (12.9)*(x/(x+1+3.76))
